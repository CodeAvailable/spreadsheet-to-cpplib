**About The Project:**
    There are many great tools available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a tool which make me a CMake lib and also it does compiles.

**How it works:**
    Just pass file name as input argument, and tool will be promoting couple of question. Just answer **yes** or **no**, rest script take care everything. You may find generated files in output folder.

**Question that tool promots:**

  Q::(1) Do you want Mathametical Expression library support for formula calculation ?
    - If you want C++ Mathematical Expression Toolkit header only library. Then please answer **yes** else **no**.
  
  Q::(2) Configure as header-only library ?
    - If you want generated output as header-only. Then please answer **yes** else **no**.
  
  Q::(3) Get default value from formula as double.?
    - If you want Formaul to be present as string in generated output. Then please answer **yes** else **no**.
  
  Q::(4) Make string as 0.0?
    - If you want any string as zero in generated output. Then please answer **yes** else **no**.
